Thanks to Mike Bostok for D3.

Apologies for the sloppy code.

This is just a quick back of the napkin tool to draw out a network diagram
from an edge list copied any pasted from excel. The edge list
existing as two adjacent columns.

Device names and port names must be delimited by a semicolon.

Probably a good idea to remove any whitespace prior to cutting
and pasting in the data.

As of now there should be NO whitespace after the last entry.

Hopefully someone else can find this useful. This was created
mostly out of the frustration of staring at a list of
network connections and trying to get a feel for the topology.

The nodes are dragable, hopefully everything else is self explanatory.
